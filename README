VARIOUS C++ EXAMPLES (INCLUDING IPC C++)

This project consists of various C++ examples from very basic concepts
to somewhat more complex subject matter. In particular, basic C++
language features are demonstrated here alongside some fairly complex
IPC (interprocess communications) implementations. As of 6-15-04 this
is a fairly basic set of examples which demonstrates the following: 

{Fundamentals}
C++ iterations constructs examples.
C++ function overloading examples.
Simple C++ templates.
Simple C++ stream buffer overloading and inheritance.
Virtual functions and abstract classes examples.

{IPC stuff}
C++ with pthreads (POSIX threads).
pthread control through C++ constructs.
Basic Thread management (fairly complex) using C++.

I expect to add to this project in the near future and I understand
that it may be a little difficult to follow at first. If you have any
questions or comments, please email me (parasyte@sleepingstill.com).

NOTE: Some ambiguity may occur due to the way Doxygen (the source
code documentation system I use here) recurses directories. In
particular, browsing source files sometimes yields unexpected results
when clicking on a link that is of the same name between more than one
project or program. Doxygen is not designed to determine which
programs go with which code and will sometimes create improper links
when namespaces are ambiguous. If this should happen, simply click on
the line number of the item you are trying to view and you will be
taken to the correct documentation.
