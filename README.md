# VARIOUS C++ EXAMPLES (INCLUDING IPC C++)

This project consists of various C++ examples from very basic concepts to somewhat more complex subject matter. In particular, basic C++ language features are demonstrated here alongside some fairly complex IPC (interprocess communications) implementations.

## Fundamentals
* C++ iterations constructs examples.
* C++ function overloading examples.
* Simple C++ templates.
* Simple C++ stream buffer overloading and inheritance.
* Virtual functions and abstract classes examples.

## IPC stuff
* C++ with pthreads (POSIX threads).
* pthread control through C++ constructs.
* Basic Thread management (fairly complex) using C++.
